      <description>Kevin Huang kyh283 Introduction I gathered general data on Dueberâ€™s 96-plasmid yeast toolkit (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/sb500366v) as well as data relating to a specific prep of these 96 plasmids. The 96-plasmid yeast toolkit is a standardized set of DNA parts which enables the high-throughput, combinatorial assembly of yeast genes. This is interesting to me because I am currently working with this particular toolkit in lab.
The first dataset (info) contains the plasmid name, part type, part description, and E.</description>

      <description>Kevin Huang kyh283 0. Introduction The dataset is sourced from a study on income dynamics (https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096586?seq=1) and reports individual log wages (lwage) from 1976 to 1982. For each individual, years of full-time work (exp), weeks worked (wks), and years of education (ed). Binary variables include marriage status (married), sex (sex), residence in the south (south), and more (https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/Ecdat/Wages.html). In total, there are 4,165 observations of 12 variables.
