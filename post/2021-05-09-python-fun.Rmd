Learning python for the first time has been super fun and interesting. Here is an example of indexing with python:

```{python}
list=['rooster','wombat','whale','cat','hedgehog']
list[3:]
```

The code returns elements after index 3 (first element is 0).

Here's how python and R can interact with each other:

```{R}
library(reticulate)
q<-"SDS"
```

```{python}
q="348"
print(r.q,q)
```

```{R}
cat(c(q,py$q))
```
